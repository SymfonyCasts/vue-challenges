  question: |
    Suppose we have a vue component that looks like this:

    ```javascript
    const app = new Vue({
      el: '#app',
      template: '<span class="title">{{ title }}</span>
    });
    ```

    and you want to add `title` as a new "data" key to this component.
    How could we do that *and* set its initial value to `Vue challenge!`
    how would you go about initializing this data?
  explanation: |
    That's right! `data` is a function that returns an object. The properties
    in this object will be accessible from the template! The function shorthand
    syntax - `data() {}` instead of `data: function() {}` - allows us to make our component more readable.

        d: |
          ```javascript
          data: '',
          ```
      correct: b

  question: |
    Suppose we have a Vue component that looks like this:

    ```javascript
    const app = new Vue({
        el: '#app',
        template: '<span class="title">{{ title }}</span>
    });
    ```

    and you want to add `title` as a new "data" key to this component.
    How could we do that *and* set its initial value to `Vue challenge!`.
    How would you go about initializing this data?
  explanation: |
    That's right! `data` is a function that returns an object. The properties
    in this object will be accessible from the template! The function shorthand
    syntax - `data() {}` instead of `data: function() {}` - allows us to make our
    component more readable.

extending_singlefilecomponent:
  question: |
    Imagine you want to build a `.vue` single file component that renders a
    page header. It needs to have a `title` data key that it uses to render the
    template.

    Which one of these code snippets would accomplish this?
  explanation: |
    Correct! A vue single file component has at least 2 elements: a `<template>`
    tag that holds the template and a `<script>` tag that `export default`
    one object with the rest of the options.

    anything!

extending_childcomponent:
  question: |
    Which of these is NOT a reason to consider breaking a component
    into smaller sub-components?
  explanation: |
    Correct! Splitting a component into smaller components can help you reuse code,
    isolate complex logic, or make your templates smaller and more readable. But
    this has no (significant) effect on the final size of your JavaScript code.
  features:
    multiple_choice:
      choices:
        a: Part of the component has a special functionality/logic.
        b: Part of the component needs to be reused in other parts of the application.
        c: Extracting part of the component will make its footprint smaller.
        d: Extracting part of a template into a sub-component will make it easier to read and understand.
      correct: c

extending_childcomponent2:
  question: |
    Suppose we have an empty component that looks like this:

    ```vue
    <template>
        <div></div>
    </template>

    <script>
    export default {
        name: 'MainComponent',
    };
    </script>
    ```

    We now want to import a child component (that lives at `@/components/title-component`)
    and render it inside `MainComponent`. What code would accomplish this?
  explanation: |
    Correct! First, you need to import the file that holds the Vue component
    (like normal JavaScript). Next, the `components` option is an *object* containing
    all of the components that you want to make *available* in the template. Once
    you've made it available, you can *use* it in the template!

    Fun fact: the reason `components` is an object is that you are *really* setting
    a key-value pair of components to make available. For example:

    ```
    export default {
        // ...
        components: {
            // this is short for TitleComponent: TitleComponent
            TitleComponent,

            // you won't do this, but it's legal to set any key to a component
            // this would allow us to use <foo /> in the template to render the title
            foo: TitleComponent
        },
    };

    Which option would NOT be a valid way to define the `title` prop?
  explanation: |
    Correct! To define `props` for our component, we need to declare the

    Ok! Say we have a TitleComponent that accepts a `title` prop.

    Imagine that we want to pass the string `Discount Broken Furniture` to it
    from a parent component. What's the correct way to do this in a template?
  explanation: |
    That's right! Props behave exactly like HTML attributes in Vue! The easiest
    way to pass down a prop is to just declare it staticaly as an attribute.
    In our next lesson, we explore the other way of passing a prop: Using the

extending_dynamicattributes:
  question: |
    Suppose we have a component named `TitleComponent` that is ready to be
    used. This component accepts a `title` prop and we want to populate it with
    the value of an imaginary data key called `categoryName`. Our main component
    looks like this:

    ```vue
    <template>
        <title-component />
    </template>

    <script>
    import TitleComponent from '@/components/title-component';

    export default {

            TitleComponent

            }
        },
    };
    </script>
    ```

    How would you pass this value down to a property of `title-component`
    using the shortcut syntax?
  explanation: |
    Correct! When using the shortcut syntax - equivalent to `v-bind:title` - we're
    converting the attribute value into a JavaScript expression where we can
    access all our object's props and data members directly. So doing
    `:title="ourTitle"` will work just fine!

    Say we have a component with a prop `title` defined using the simple
    syntax:

    But now, we'd like Vue to be able to do some validation for us when
    the component is rendered: we want `title` to accept a String and to
    be required. How can we do this?
  explanation: |
    Correct! We *need* to pass an object whose members are equal to the names
    of our defined props. Each member is  itself another object with the
    options `type` - which can be equal to a JavaScript type object, like
    `String` - and `required`, which is a boolean.

    > When `required` is `false`, you can also define a `default` value using
    > that option.

    That's right, the only thing you need to add to it in order to make it

    Delicious! Now e want to loop through these fruits and show each of them in a `span`
    element. What's the best way to accomplish this?
  explanation: |
    That's correct! The `v-for` directive will produce copies of itself,
    each rendering one element in the array that you are looping through. The `:key`
    attribute helps Vue make better updates if the contents of `fruit` change!

    > Note you can also loop through Objects using this directive!
    > `v-for="(value, key) in object"` will do it!

    > If you are iterating through an Object and *still* need to get an index
    > number, you can use the syntax:
    > `v-for="(value, key, index) in object"`

extending_reactivity:
  question: |
    Generally speaking, how does Vue go about making your `data` and `props` members
    reactive? In other words: how is Vue smart enough to re-render components
    when `data` or `props` change?
  explanation: |
    That's right! Vue turns your `data` and `prop` members into getter and setter functions.
    When those properties are complex objects, it even does this recursively!
    When you access a key in `data` or `props`, Vue uses the getter to keep an
    internal list of all components thta *use* that key. And when you *set*
    a key on `data`, Vue is then able to notify all components that use that key.
    *Then* those components can re-render.

  question: |
    Suppose we have a component that at some point renders a "Loading" message and we

    ```vue
    <template>
        <span>Loading...</span>

        <h1>Pizza Menu</h1>

        <pizza-menu-list />

    What is the best way of showing and hiding this "Loading" `<span>`?
  explanation: |
    Exactly! Vue has a directive ready for just these sort of cases! We don't need to

  question: |
    Let's say we have a class called `.controversial-flavour` in a modular css tag. We want
    to assign this class to an element in the Template if our pizzas cointain pineapple. For this,
    we've constructed a component like this:

    ```vue
    <template>
        <div :class="$style.component">
          <span>{{ pizza.name }}</span>
        </div>

    .component {
        width: 120px;
        display: inline-block

        .controversial-flavour {
            color: red;
        }
    }
    </style>
    ```

    We know that `pizza` has a property called `containsPineapple`, which is a boolean.
    How can we conditionally show the class `.controversial-flavour` if our pizza contains
    pineapple?
  explanation: |
    That's right! We're faced with the problem of, first, referencing a class which name
    has a `-` in it, so we have to use `[]` around our `$style` member like so:

    ```javascript
    $style['controversial-flavour']
    ```

    But that is not all! In including this property as an object key, we *again* need
    to enclose this into another pair of `[]`. So the result is as the one you've

    That's right. While it is possible to mutate a prop, you should *never* do that!

  question: |
    Which of these examples will NOT emit an event called `onButtonClick` when the button
    is clicked?
  explanation: |
    If you look closely, `:click` will not be executed because you are actually
    defining a dynamic attribute called `click` set to the `$emit` call. well done!

    > You can call `$emit` from the template, or from methods in your
    > component.
